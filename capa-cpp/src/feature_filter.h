// Which extracted features can possibly matter to a ruleset.
//
// The dynamic backend emits a `number` feature for every integer argument of every call
// -- pointers, handles, sizes, timestamps -- and the walk in capabilities.cpp unions each
// call's features into a thread-wide and then a process-wide FeatureSet. Those sets
// therefore grow one entry per *distinct argument value in the trace*, which on a large
// recording is tens of millions of keys, each an unordered_map node plus a std::set. That
// is what makes peak memory a function of trace length rather than of ruleset size, and it
// is the single largest allocation in the program.
//
// Almost none of it can ever be read. A feature is only observable through the handful of
// ways engine.cpp evaluates one, and most of those are exact lookups:
//
//   eval_feature's default branch   features.find(feat)      -- exact identity
//   Range (count(...))              features.find(range_child) -- exact identity
//   eval_substring / eval_regex     scan every String feature
//   eval_bytes                      scan every Bytes feature
//   eval_os                         scan every OS feature
//
// So a feature whose exact identity appears nowhere in any rule, and which is not one of
// the scanned kinds, cannot change any result. Dropping it before it reaches an
// accumulator is not an approximation -- it is unobservable by construction.
//
// This deliberately does NOT reuse RuleSet's ScopeIndex::rules_by_feature. That index
// keeps only each rule's *most selective* feature set and returns nothing for `not:`,
// `optional:` and `count(min 0)` subtrees, because it exists to pick candidate rules
// cheaply. Filtering against it would drop a feature sitting under a `not:` and flip that
// `not:` from false to true. The walk here prunes nothing.
