// Renderers for capa-cpp.
//
// Ports capa/render/{result_document,default,vverbose}.py. Produces:
//   - a JSON ResultDocument (`-j`), structurally faithful to capa's schema
//   - the default capabilities table
//   - the vverbose match-tree view (`-vv`)
//
// Backend-neutral: the renderers see a `Doc` of already-resolved analysis metadata
// plus the raw `MatchResults`, never a concrete extractor. Each backend materializes
// its own `Doc` (see `build_dynamic_doc` / `build_static_doc` in main.cpp), which is
// what lets the dynamic/TTD, static and minidump paths share one set of renderers.
